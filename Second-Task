We assume I have 4 commands, 1 help request to my manager and 3 workers, I will destribute the tasks to the workers as follow:
1st. Command: I will tell one of the worker to help me with the adjusment of the logs.
2nd. Command: I will tell the other two workers to use the the 2 hammers and drive the nails.
3th. Command: I will leave the bag full of nails in the middle and tell the 2 workers to get nails from there.
4th. Command: I will save the final command in any case, just to be safe with 1 more command.
Request to my manager will be that if he/she sees something wrong to tell it to me and the workers and follow the working process with keen eye and if there are any adjusments that the manager wants to be made to tell us.
